## Key point about Self-Driving Cars

1. <b>Rodney brooks</b> prediction in "<b>My Dated Predictions</b>":
   * <b>```>2032```</b>: A driverless "taxi" service in a major US city with arbitary pick and drop off locations, even in a restricted geographical area.
   * <b>```>2045```</b>: The majority of US cities have the majority of their downtown under such rules.
   
2. Two types of <b>AI Systems</b>
   * <b>Human-Centered Autonomy</b>: AI is not fully responsible
   * <b>Full Autonomy</b>: AI is fully responsible.
   
3. Levels of Automation
   * <b>L0</b>: All cars are manually controlled until the AI system shows itself to be available and is elected to be turned on by the human.
   * <b>L1,L2,L3</b>: Human-Centered Autonomy
   * <b>L4,L5</b>: Full Autonomy
   
4. Automative AI Sensors
   * <b>Radar</b>: Cheap, Does well in extreme weather, Low resolution, most used automotive sensor for object detection.
   * <b>LIDAR</b>: Expensive, Extremely accurate depth information, Reolution much higher than radar, 360 degrees of visibility.
   * <b>Camera</b>: Cheap, Highest resolution, Huge deep learning data, Human brains use similar sensor technology for driving, Bad at depth estimation, Not good in extreme weather.
   
5. Driver Glance Region Classification: Algorithm to classify in which direction driver is seeing.
