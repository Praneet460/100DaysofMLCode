# 100DaysofMLCode
This repository is a part of #100DaysofMLCode challenge. That means, I pledge to code machine learning for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days.
Challenge is starting from July 06, 2018.

## Day 1: July 06, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Perform the <b>classification task</b> on <b>Breast Cancer</b> dataset.
2. By Using, Keras (Tensorflow as a backend).
3. Achieve the accuracy near to <b>96%</b> after using <b>'Relu'</b> as an activation function.

### What is Keras ?

<b>Keras</b> is a high-level machine learning framework for Python under the MIT license.
To know more, see Keras official [documentation](https

## Day 2: July 07, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Explore the <b>Twitter Dataset</b> of around <b>3653 tweets</b> of PyData Connference, London.
2. Find out maximum number of characters in a tweet = <b>152</b>
3. Plot the histogram of <b>Frequency of characters in tweets</b>.
4. Find out most common words in tweets : <b>Python, datascience</b>
5. Find out most common callouts : <b>@KirkDBorne, @kdnuggets</b>
6. Find out most common hashtags : <b>#DataScience, #BigData</b>

### What is pickle format ?

By default, the pickle data format uses a relatively compact binary representation. 
If you need optimal size characteristics, you can efficiently compress pickled data.
To know more, see Pickle official [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format).


## Day 3: July 08, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Build up a Deep Learning Rest API using Keras
2. Predict the pictures of Dogs, Cats, Rabbit specific to their bread.
3. To setup your own environment and the source code [Look Here](https://github.com/Praneet460/100DaysofMLCode/tree/master/July_08_2018)


## Day 4: July 09, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Go through a series of lectures by <b>Lex Fridman</b>, a research scientist at MIT.
2. These lectures include the content about Deep Reinforcement Learning and Self-Driving Cars
3. To know more about, what I learned [Look Here](https://github.com/Praneet460/100DaysofMLCode/tree/master/July_09_2018)

## Day 5: July 10, 2018

1. Build up a Deep learning model for classifing MNIST Dataset using Keras.
2. Tried different model and predict the accuracy:

| Model         | Testing Accuracy (%) | 
| ------------- |:----------------:    | 
| Basic Model   | 11.35                | 
| He Normal     | 75.52                | 
| Relu          | 92.88                | 
| Adam          | 92.59                | 
| Adam & Relu   | 93.85                | 
| Batchnorm     | 95.46                |
| Batchnorm & Relu | 94.71                |
| Dropout       | 11.35                |
| Ensemble      | 27.93                |

3. Most methods improve the model training & test performance. That's why we will use them all together.
4. After applying all the models together we get the accuracy near to <b>98%</b>. [Look Here](https://github.com/Praneet460/100DaysofMLCode/blob/master/July_10_2018/Final_Model.ipynb)


## Day 6: July 11, 2018

### What I did?

Go through a series of lectures on self driving cars by Udacity.
