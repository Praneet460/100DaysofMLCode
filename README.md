# 100DaysofMLCode
This repository is a part of #100DaysofMLCode challenge. That means, I pledge to code machine learning for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days.
Challenge is starting from July 06, 2018.

## Day 1: July 06, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Perform the <b>classification task</b> on <b>Breast Cancer</b> dataset.
2. By Using, Keras (Tensorflow as a backend).
3. Achieve the accuracy near to <b>96%</b> after using <b>'Relu'</b> as an activation function.

### What is Keras ?

<b>Keras</b> is a high-level machine learning framework for Python under the MIT license.
To know more, see Keras official [documentation](https

## Day 2: July 07, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Explore the <b>Twitter Dataset</b> of around <b>3653 tweets</b> of PyData Connference, London.
2. Find out maximum number of characters in a tweet = <b>152</b>
3. Plot the histogram of <b>Frequency of characters in tweets</b>.
4. Find out most common words in tweets : <b>Python, datascience</b>
5. Find out most common callouts : <b>@KirkDBorne, @kdnuggets</b>
6. Find out most common hashtags : <b>#DataScience, #BigData</b>

### What is pickle format ?

By default, the pickle data format uses a relatively compact binary representation. 
If you need optimal size characteristics, you can efficiently compress pickled data.
To know more, see Pickle official [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#data-stream-format).
